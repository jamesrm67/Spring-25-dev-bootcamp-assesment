                Hello! I'm from Ashburn, VA, and a current involvement I’m passionate about is GOALSoccer, where I play soccer and mentor kids with disabilities every sunday. I’ve played soccer most of my life and it is a passion I love to share and enjoy with others. While I do enjoy playing soccer, what I am passionate about is building and maintaining relationships with the kids that come regularly. They certainly brighten my life and I try my best to brighten theirs. Through a different means, I want to accomplish this same goal at Bits of Good.
